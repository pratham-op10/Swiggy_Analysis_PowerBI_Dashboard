## 🔍 Key Features of the Dashboard

1. **Customer Insights**
   - Number of customers by city/state
   - Customer activity trends (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Retention and churn patterns

2. **Order Analytics**
   - Order volume over time
   - Average order value

- **Excel/CSV** – assumed as data sources (imported into Power BI)
- **DAX** – for calculated columns, measures, and KPIs
- **Power Query** – for data transformation and cleaning

## 📈 Business Use Case
